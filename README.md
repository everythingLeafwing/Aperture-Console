# Aperture Console
this is a console meant to look like that seen in Aperture Science Laboratories, featured during the end credits of Valve's "Portal 2" and on computer screens during the near-end of Valve's "Portal"


the program isn't in a working state *yet*, but as of now this is how the program is planned to look like: <br>

there will be two versions of the program, one will use c# wpf A.K.A. .NET, the other will use c++, the framework of which has not been decided yet (since I'm new to UI in c++ I don't really know how to make a good gui). Expect the c++ version to take longer (much longer).
