# Aperture Console
this is a console meant to look like that seen in Aperture Science Laboratories, featured during the end credits of Valve's "Portal 2" and on computer screens during the near-end of Valve's "Portal"


the program isn't in a working state *yet*, but as of now this is how the program is planned to look like: <br>
<img src="concept/concept1.png"/>

there are three planned versions of the program, one runs in Python's Pygame, one runs with C++, and one will use the C# wpf framework. the c++ will be the main version found in the main branch of this program, the python pygame version will be a bit less stable I'd assume but is better if you want to edit the source code, and the c# version will have the best user interface.

<!-- this part will have to be changed once development has got to a good point -->
as of now none of the versions have finished development so you will not be able to download any of them just yet.
